## About 📖

This is a website for my second-year Visual Design module, VIO-202. The goal was to create a **portfolio page** to showcase 2-3 of our previous projects from the year. Our projects for this year focused on extending the comic book we designed and created from last year. We animated the comic from first year, as well as created a trailer (not featured here) and an infographic to "advertise" the comic and give more information on the world and it's characters. Thus, this website is themed after the comic. 

The less text we used, the better, as we were supposed to visually convey points as much as possible.

I used an online design / animation tool [Rive](https://rive.app/) to create my interactive animated graphics for my projects this year. I really enjoyed using Rive and I have gotten to watch it develop (from dec 2021-2022) and it's been really cool to see what features have come out (not sponsored haha). I also used [fullpage.js](https://alvarotrigo.com/fullPage/) for the vertical smooth scrolling.
